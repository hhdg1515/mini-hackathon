# Getting Started
This is a project from MINI Hackathon Codedex. 

Track Selection
For this Hackathon, I chose Track 1. I was torn between designing for Instagram, Threads, TikTok, or Twitter. Then I had a nostalgic momentâ€”back in the 90s, phones werenâ€™t smart. No photo or video uploads, yet simple digital communication brought so much joy. That inspired me to reimagine Twitter in the late 90s!

My Project
The 90s Twitter Retro Design is inspired by MSN and early web interfaces, focusing on text, emojis, and meaningful interactions. I embedded some 90s goin-ons in the Public Updates section.

ðŸ‘‰ Thumbs Ups, Retweets, and Comments: Interact with the posts, including conversations between celebrities.
ðŸ‘‰ Post Your Own Tweet: Type in the dialog box, hit Tweet, and your post will appear alongside legends like MJ heading for his 4th championship with the Bulls.

This MVP feature, along with the nostalgic design, captures the spirit of the 90s. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, sticking to tools available at the time. Using Figma in this process felt ironic, but it was still helpful! ðŸ˜Š

Reflections
This weekend Hackathon was both fun and challenging as someone balancing family responsibilities in their late 30s. It reminded me of the thrill of trying something new in my 20s. After refining the layout, Iâ€™m thrilled with how it turned out!

Final Thanks
Huge thanks to the Codedex Community for organizing such an inclusive and inspiring event. We did it! ðŸŽ‰
